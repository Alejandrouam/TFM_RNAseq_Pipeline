The ionotropic glutamate receptor complex itself acts as a ligand gated ion channel; on binding glutamate, charged ions pass through a channel in the center of the receptor complex. The AMPA receptors mediate fast synaptic transmission in the CNS and are composed of subunits GluR1-4, products from separate genes. These subunits have an extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus. [GOC:ef]";30;0,78462595;1,1460996;0,31260505;0,8922323;1;2292;"tags=37%, list=6%, signal=39%"

The latter process most of the time leads to only partial secretion of the granule content. Exocytosis begins with steps that prepare vesicles for fusion with the membrane (tethering and docking) and ends when molecules are secreted from the cell.

It is the site of protein biosynthesis resulting from translation of messenger RNA (mRNA). It consists of two subunits, one large and one small, each containing only protein and RNA. Both the ribosome and its subunits are characterized by their sedimentation coefficients, expressed in Svedberg units (symbol: S). Hence, the prokaryotic ribosome (70S) comprises a large (50S) subunit and a small (30S) subunit, while the eukaryotic ribosome (80S) comprises a large (60S) subunit and a small (40S) subunit. Two sites on the ribosomal large subunit are involved in translation, namely the aminoacyl site (A site) and peptidyl site (P site). Ribosomes from prokaryotes, eukaryotes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts have characteristically distinct ribosomal proteins.

The kinases in each tier phosphorylate and activate the kinases in the downstream tier. The JNK cascade is activated by stress signals, as well as by G protein-coupled receptors, growth factors, and cytokines, and results in cellular responses such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, apoptosis and inflammation.
